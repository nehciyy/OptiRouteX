# OptiRouteX

OptiRouteX is a program designed to optimize and calculate the shortest possible route between specified locations using genetic algorithms. The program uses latitude and longitude coordinates for various waypoints, an origin, and a destination to determine the optimal path.

### Features

- **Dynamic Route Optimization**: Calculates the shortest possible route between the origin, destination, and waypoints using genetic algorithms.
- **Real-Time Map Rendering**: Visualizes the optimized route on an interactive map interface.
- **Real-Time Traffic Integration**: Incorporates real-time traffic data into the route optimization process, dynamically adjusting the route to avoid congested areas.
- **Waypoint Management**: Easily customize and manage waypoints through a JSON configuration file.

## File Structure and Descriptions

### Root Directory

- **`app.py`**: This file acts as the main API server for the application, handling requests related to the route optimization process.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that renders the frontend interface where users can interact with the map and see the optimized route.
- **`rollup.config.js`**: Configuration file for Rollup.js, which is used to bundle the JavaScript modules into a single file for use in the application.

### `src` Directory

- **`config.js`**: Contains configuration settings, such as API keys and other constants, required by the JavaScript components of the application.
- **`distanceMeasure.js`**: Handles the logic for measuring distances between waypoints, origin, and destination. This is a core component that interacts with the genetic algorithm.
- **`index.js`**: The main JavaScript entry point for the frontend, responsible for initializing the map and setting up interactions with other components.
- **`location.js`**: Manages the retrieval and formatting of location data from the JSON file, making it accessible to other parts of the application.
- **`mapSingleton.js`**: Implements a singleton pattern for managing the map instance, ensuring that only one instance of the map exists at any time.

### `data` Directory

- **`bestRoute/`**: Contains the best-optimized route file, saved after the algorithm completes its execution.
- **`generationResults/`**: Stores detailed results of each generation during the route optimization process, providing insights into the evolution of the algorithm.
- **`evaluation.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook for evaluating and visualizing the performance of the genetic algorithm, useful for analysis and debugging.

### `dist` Directory

- **`bundle.js`**: The bundled JavaScript file generated by Rollup.js, containing all the necessary JavaScript code for the frontend in a single, optimized file.

### `models` Directory

- **`locations.json`**: The configuration file where all location data (origin, destination, and waypoints) is stored. This file is used by the program to perform route calculations.
- **`algorithm.py`**: The core Python script that implements the genetic algorithm for route optimization, interacting with other components like `distanceMeasure.js` to dynamically calculate the best route.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up the Locations

Before running the program, ensure that the locations are properly set up in the JSON file located at `./models/locations.json`. The JSON file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "origin": {
    "lat": 1.292982,
    "lng": 103.857003,
    "//": "Suntec City"
  },
  "destination": {
    "lat": 1.300639,
    "lng": 103.854837,
    "//": "Bugis Junction"
  },
  "waypoints": {
    "Merlion": {
      "lat": 1.28668,
      "lng": 103.853607
    },
    "313 Somerset": {
      "lat": 1.301114,
      "lng": 103.838872
    },
    "Marina Bay Sands": {
      "lat": 1.28437,
      "lng": 103.8599
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Notes:

- **Do Not Change the "origin" and "destination" Keys**: The keys `"origin"` and `"destination"` are required by the program. **Only change the `lat`, `lng`, and `//` values** under these keys to update the coordinates and description.

- **Waypoints Formatting**: For the waypoints, you can customize the name of each waypoint as a key (e.g., `"Merlion"`, `"313 Somerset"`) and provide the corresponding `lat` and `lng` values. Ensure that each waypoint follows this format.

You can obtain the latitude and longitude coordinates from [findlatitudeandlongitude](https://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/) for coordinates.

Here is where you can retrieve the latitude and longitude:

### 2. Running the Program

To start the program, follow these steps by running commands in three consecutive terminals:

- **Step 1:** Open the first terminal and run the command:

  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

- **Step 2:** Open a second terminal and, after running `python app.py`, execute the following commands:

  ```bash
  npm run bundle
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

- **Step 3:** Open a third terminal and run the command:

  ```bash
  python models/algorithm.py
  ```

All three terminals need to be running simultaneously as they are interdependent and work together to execute the program.

### 3. Retrieving Results

After running the program, you can find the following results stored in the data folder:

- Best Route: The best optimized route calculated by the algorithm.
- Generation Results: Detailed results for each generation during the route optimization process.

## Notes

- Ensure all configurations and settings are correctly set before running the program.
- Regularly update the `locations.json` file to reflect any changes in your waypoints or geographical data.
